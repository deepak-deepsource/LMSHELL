DESCRIPTION
       The  exec() family of functions replaces the current process image with
       a new process image.

Note: Run make to compile different targets; execForeign is a foreign executable (its image will replace the execMain process)

Example:
./execMain 1 2 3

OUTPUT:
Original Process, PID: 7029
Running with arguments:
[0] ./execMain
[1] 1
[2] 2
[3] 3
Foreign executable, PID: 7029
Running with arguments:
[0] ./execForeign
[1] 1
[2] 2
[3] 3
