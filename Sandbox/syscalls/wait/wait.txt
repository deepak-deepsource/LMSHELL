DESCRIPTION
       All of these system calls are used to wait for state changes in a child
       of the calling process, and obtain information about  the  child  whose
       state  has changed.  A state change is considered to be: the child ter‚Äê
       minated; the child was stopped by a signal; or the child was resumed by
       a  signal.  In the case of a terminated child, performing a wait allows
       the system to release the resources associated with  the  child;  if  a
       wait  is not performed, then the terminated child remains in a "zombie"
       state.
